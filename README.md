# Tfl_Visualization_Project
This is a project that was implemented for evaluation purposes during the "Managing and Visualizing Data" module in the Department of Statistics, LSE. The project's aim is to understand transportation user behaviour in the UK so as to formulate policies to encourage the UK's Net-Zero goals. To that extent, several data sources were utilized, such as publicly available 'Transport for London' datasets, as well as web-scraped cycle and tube data.
